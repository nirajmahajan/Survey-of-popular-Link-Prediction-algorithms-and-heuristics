# Survey of Popular Link-Prediction Algorithms

CS768 Course Project, Autumn 2020.

Link Prediction is a key problem for network structured data. It has wide
practical applications in social networks, citation networks, and so on. Given
a snapshot of a social network, can we infer which new interactions can be
added based on the structure of the graph? This question is answered by Link
prediction. In this survey, we compare the performance of various heuristics
based methods and some popular supervised algorithms in link prediction.
